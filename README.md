Thoughts to self (and anyone else who wants to read them)...

## 2022-08-01 | Monday

Started studying for PenTest+ over the weekend (yesterday). I got a book ([Sybex Study Guide](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-PenTest-Study-Guide-PT0-002/dp/1119823811/ref=sr_1_1)) and I started looking around for lab ideas. I need practical application, skills drills, to "do" stuff vs. just read stuff. I think I've settled on two lab project "areas" for now, and then I have ideas for later if need be. 
- **Current Labs**: [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com/path/outline/pentestplus) and [101 Labs](https://www.amazon.com/101-Labs-CompTIA-PenTest-Hands/dp/1916871216/ref=sr_1_1).
- I also thought about using [VulnLab](https://www.vulnhub.com/) machines. They have an excellent [list of resources](https://www.vulnhub.com/resources/), too.
- [HTB](https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/how-to-become-a-pentester) has some really cool stuff (but I'm thinking about using HTB for my next round of certs: CEH & OSCP). Can't do it all at once... so, I decided to start with TryHackMe then "graduate" to HTB if I can.

Pretty cool. Very much looking forward to learning this stuff.
